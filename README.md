# MacTweaks
A program that enable tweaks I'm making to my mac

This project is not really ready for public consumption atm, as there are loads of things specific to my device ( E.x. DLLImport path )

# Feature List
- Click on dock icon to hide app
- Click on bottom right corner to hide all apps
- Click on window's red cross to quit application entirely ( Should there be 1 window left )
- Command+Q to close Finder window
- Command+Delete to eject volumes
- Command+X to cut files and folders
- Retain brightness when toggling low power mode ( ON / OFF ).
- Reset low power config to "Low power mode on battery only" when plugged back into AC. This is useful when you wish to override power settings to use high performance mode for certain workloads while running on battery.
- Auto bypass "Enter admin password" dialog!!!
