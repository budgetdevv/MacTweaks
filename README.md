# MacTweaks
A program that enable tweaks I'm making to my mac

This project is not really ready for public consumption atm, as there are loads of things specific to my device ( E.x. DLLImport path )

# Feature List

- Click on bottom right corner to hide all apps

- Click red cross to quit application entirely ( Should there be 1 window left )
