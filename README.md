# MacTweaks
A program that enable tweaks I'm making to my mac

This project is not really ready for public consumption atm, as there are loads of things specific to my device ( E.x. DLLImport path )

# Feature List
- Click on dock icon to hide app
- Click on bottom right corner to hide all apps
- Click on window's red cross to quit application entirely ( Should there be 1 window left )
- CommandQ to close Finder window
- CommandDelete to eject volumes
- CommandX to cut files and folders
- Retain brightness when toggling low power mode ( ON / OFF ). Only works for low power mode caused by plugging / unpluggin AC atm.
  Note that there isn't really a way to know if brightness value changed, unless via polling. Polling may cause this app to be less power efficient
